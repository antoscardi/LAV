  abstract={This paper describes a novel autonomous ground vehicle that is designed for exploring unknown 
            environments which contain sources of ionising radiation, such as might be found in a nuclear 
            disaster site or a legacy nuclear facility. While exploring the environment, it is important that 
            the robot avoids radiation hot spots to minimise breakdowns. Broken down robots present a real 
            problem: they not only cause the mission to fail but they can block access routes for future missions. 
            New software algorithms are presented that allow radiation measurements to be converted into a format 
            in which they can be integrated into the robot’s navigation system so that it can actively avoid 
            receiving a high radiation dose during a mission. An unmanned ground vehicle was fitted with a 
            gamma radiation detector and an autonomous navigation package that included the new radiation 
            avoidance software. The full system was evaluated experimentally in a complex semi-structured 
            environment that contained two radiation sources. In the experiment, the robot successfully 
            identified both sources and avoided areas that were found to have high levels of radiation while 
            navigating between user-defined waypoints. This advancement in the state-of-the-art has the 
            potential to deliver real benefit to the nuclear industry, in terms of both increased chance of 
            mission success and reduction of the reliance on human operatives to perform tasks in dangerous 
            radiation environments.},

  ABSTRACT = {Searching multiple targets with swarm robots is a realistic and significant problem. The goal 
              is to search the targets in the minimum time while avoiding collisions with other robots. In this 
              paper, inspired by pedestrian behavior, swarm robotic pedestrian behavior (SRPB) was proposed. It 
              considered many realistic constraints in the multi-target search problem, including limited 
              communication range, limited working time, unknown sources, unknown extrema, the arbitrary initial 
              location of robots, non-oriented search, and no central coordination. The performance of different 
              cooperative strategies was evaluated in terms of average time to find the first, the half, and the 
              last source, the number of located sources and the collision rate. Several experiments with different 
              target signals, fixed initial location, arbitrary initial location, different population sizes, and 
              the different number of targets were implemented. It was demonstrated by numerous experiments that 
              SRPB had excellent stability, quick source seeking, a high number of located sources, and a low 
              collision rate in various search strategies.},

              based on niching particle swarm optimization is presented in this study. In this method, a robot is 
              regarded as a particle, particles located at a neighbor form a niche, and different niches are 
              employed to localize different odor sources synchronously. In order to localize more odor sources, 
              the size of each niche is dynamically adjusted based on the aggregation degree of its elements. A 
              niche merging strategy, based on the similarity of optimal particles found by niches, is proposed 
              to prevent particles repeatedly searching for the same region. In addition, some real conditions 
              such as the sampling/recovery time of a sensor and the velocity limit of a robot are considered when 
              updating the position of a particle. Finally, the proposed method is applied to various scenarios 
              of localizing multiple odor sources, and the experimental results confirm its effectiveness.}

 abstractNote={ We present a mixed-initiative planning and execution system for human multi-drones interaction during search and rescue missions. 
                The proposed system should allow a single operator to supervise and orchestrate the operations of a set of UAVs by means of a natural multimodal communication. 
                In particular, we consider the task of searching for missing persons in a real-world alpine scenario. 
                In this context, we assume that the human operator is an alpine rescuer, involved in the scene and co-located with the drones, hence not fully dedicated to the robotic platforms, but only able to provide sparse and sketchy interventions. 
                This scenario requires a framework that supports adjustable autonomy, from explicit teleoperation to a complete autonomy, and an effective and natural mixed-initiative interaction between the human and the robotic team. 
                In this paper, we illustrate the domain and the overall framework discussing the system at work in a simulated case study. &lt;/p&gt; },

ABSTRACT = {The edge detection method based on the magnetic gradient tensor data plays an important role in magnetic exploration because it is free from geomagnetic interference and contains more abundant information. 
            This paper proposes a new anomaly edge detection method using the magnetic gradient tensor components. 
            The model is established to compare with other methods, such as directional total horizontal derivative (THDz), analytical signal (AS), tilt angle, theta map, and so on, under conditions of vertical magnetization, oblique magnetization, and noise interference. 
            Through the study of the anomaly distribution of the rectangular model, it is observed that the edge detection method proposed in this paper is nearly impervious to noise interference,
            exhibits strong anti-interference capabilities, delivers a high-quality boundary identification effect, and provides greater accuracy in anomaly edges with minimal error. 
            When multiple anomalous bodies are present, the edge detection results are less susceptible to interference from each other, resulting in higher resolution. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by real magnetic data from some study areas in Jiangxi Province, China. 
            The experimental results show that the proposed method is more precise and accurate than the total horizontal derivative, analytical signal, tilt angle, and theta map methods.},

ABSTRACT = {The existing magnetic target localization methods are greatly affected by the geomagnetic field and exist approximation errors. 
In this paper, a two-point magnetic gradient tensor localization model is established by using the spatial relation between the magnetic target and the observation points derived from magnetic gradient tensor and tensor invariants. 
Based on the model, the equations relating to the position vector of magnetic target are constructed. 
Solving the equations, a new magnetic target localization method using only a two-point magnetic gradient tensor and no approximation errors is achieved. 
To accurately evaluate the localization accuracy of the method, a circular trajectory that varies in all three directions is proposed. 
Simulation results show that the proposed method is almost error-free in the absence of noise. After adding noise, the maximum relative error percentage is reduced by 28.4percento and 2.21percento compared with the single-point method and the other two-point method, respectively. 
Furthermore, the proposed method is not affected by the variation in the distance between two observation points. At a detection distance of 20 m, the maximum localization error is 1.86 m. 
In addition, the experiments also verify that the new method can avoid the influence of the geomagnetic field and the variation in the distance, and achieve high localization accuracy. 
The average relative error percentage in the y-direction is as low as 3.78 percento.},

  abstract={For a number of widely used models, normalized source strength (NSS) can be derived from eigenvalues of the magnetic gradient tensor. 
            The NSS is proportional to a constant q normalized by the nth power of the distance between observation and integration points where q is a shape factor depending upon geometry of the model and n is the structural index. 
            The NSS is independent of magnetization direction, and its amplitude is only affected by the magnitude of magnetization. The NSS is also a homogenous function and satisfies Euler’s homogeneity equation. 
            Therefore, Euler deconvolution of the NSS can be used to estimate source location. In our algorithm, we use data points enclosed by a square window centered at maxima of the NSS for simultaneously estimating the source location and structural index. 
            The window size is increased until it exceeds a predefined limit. Then the most reliable solution is chosen based on some statistical analysis (minimum uncertainty). 
            One of the advantages of the presented method is that it allows automatic identification of the structural index as the constant background field is eliminated. 
            Another advantage is reduction of interference effects from neighboring sources by differentiation of the NSS. 
            We have compared our method with the analytic signal amplitude and when the magnetic source contains remanent magnetization with a different direction to the inducing field, the NSS provides more reliable information about source geometry. 
            Application of the method has been demonstrated on an aeromagnetic data set from the Tuckers Igneous Complex, Queensland, Australia. 
            The NSS has improved interpretation of magnetic anomalies for this igneous complex, for which available geologic information shows relatively strong remanent magnetization.}

            The difference between the proposed method and the general PSO is to split up the original single population into several subpopulations according to the order of particles. 
            The best particle within each subpopulation is recorded and then applied into the velocity updating formula to replace the original global best particle in the whole population. 
            To update all particles in each subpopulation, the modified velocity formula is utilized. 
            Based on the idea of multiple subpopulations, for the multimodal function optimization the several optima including the global and local solutions may probably be found by these best particles separately. 
            To show the efficiency of the proposed method, two kinds of function optimizations are provided, including a single modal function optimization and a complex multimodal function optimization. 
            Simulation results will demonstrate the convergence behavior of particles by the number of iterations, and the global and local system solutions are solved by these best particles of subpopulations.}

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a simple and efficient optimization method that has been used in many fields. However, PSO has some flaws including premature convergence and poor population diversity. To solve these problems of PSO, an adaptive dynamic multi-swarm particle swarm optimization with stagnation detection and spatial exclusion (ADPSO) is proposed. The newly proposed ADPSO is based on a dynamic multi-swarm PSO framework that cooperates with stagnation detection mechanism (SDM) and spatial exclusion strategy (SES). Firstly, the whole population is divided into multiple equal sub-swarms, which can be regrouped during evolution. The best particle of each sub-swarm, lbest, is used to evaluate the evolutionary state of each sub-swarm. If the lbest cannot improve its solution continuously without reaching the regroup period, the SDM will be triggered. In this case, a vitality particle is generated to help the stagnant sub-swarm to search for promising areas again. To keep the population diversity, the vitality particle is constructed according to the excellent historical information of all particles in the whole population. Secondly, to enhance the diversity of the population, the SES is proposed to avoid premature adsorption of all sub-swarms. Finally, the effect of ADPSO is evaluated using CEC2013, CEC2017 and four engineering optimization problems. The results shows that the proposed ADPSO is suitable for solving most optimization problems, and ADPSO has better results compared to the state-of-the-art PSO variants (i.e., MSCPSO, HCDMPS) and other popular evolutionary algorithms.}

In this algorithm, the swarm population is divided into two subpopulations. Each subpopulation is assigned to focus solely on either exploration or exploitation. Comprehensive learning (CL) strategy is used to generate the exemplars for both subpopulations. In the exploration-subpopulation, the exemplars are generated by using personal best experiences of the particles in the exploration-subpopulation itself. In the exploitation-subpopulation, the personal best experiences of the entire swarm population are used to generate the exemplars. As the exploration-subpopulation does not learn from any particles in the exploitation-subpopulation, the diversity in the exploration-subpopulation can be retained even if the exploitation-subpopulation converges prematurely. The heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm is tested on shifted and rotated benchmark problems and compared with other recent particle swarm optimization algorithms to demonstrate superior performance of the proposed algorithm over other particle swarm optimization variants.}

First, a nonlinear mathematical model for a quadrotor vehicle is derived, which includes translational and rotational dynamics. Then a robust feedback linearization controller is developed, which sacrifices the controllability of the yaw state due to rotor failure to linearize the closed-loop system around a working point, where roll and pitch angles are zero and the angular speed around the vertical axis is a nonzero constant. An H∞ loop shaping technique is adopted to achieve regulation of these variables around the chosen working point. Finally, an outer loop is proposed for achieving control of the linear displacement under the assumption of small angles approximation for the pitch and roll angles. The proposed control strategy allows the vehicle to use the remaining three functional rotors to enter a constant angular speed around its vertical axis, granting stability and representing an effective way to deal with a rotor failure in quadrotor vehicles. }
