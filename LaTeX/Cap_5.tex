\chapter{Experiments}
In the context of search and rescue (S\&R) missions, the number of available 
UAVs is typically limited (ranging from 1 to 10 \cite{PSO_original}), and the search area 
usually spans only a few thousand square meters.
Therefore, it is reasonable to 
assume the presence of a communication network with a static topology, allowing 
for the implementation of a centralized estimation algorithm.
PUT ADVANTAGES OF DECENTRALIZED APPROACH
QUESTO Ãˆ QUELLO CHE AVEVAMO SCRITTO NEL PROGETTO
Furthermore, decentralization provides improved robustness to "communication noise" by removing 
dependence on a central computation unit. This autonomy enables the system to adapt to varying 
communication conditions, such as intermittent information availability or delays, thus supporting 
continued operation in challenging environments such asmountain regions and adverse weather 
conditions, like in our scenario. While decentralized methods may exhibit slower convergence and slightly higher estimation 
errors due to partial information exchange, they remain effective and efficient in situations where 
centralized coordination is impractical or demands excessive resources.
