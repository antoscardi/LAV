%                                               PARTICLE CLASS                                                   %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The Particle class represents each individual drone in the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
% Each particle stores its current position and velocity, as well as its personal best position and the associated
% best NSS value (signal strength) found so far.
%
% Properties:
% - position: The current position of the particle (x, y).
% - velocity: The current velocity of the particle (x, y).
% - p_best: The best position found by the particle so far.
% - nss_best_value: The highest NSS value achieved at the personal best position.
% - nss_value: The current NSS value at the particle's current position.
% - bounds: The boundaries within which the particle must stay.
%
% Methods:
% - update_velocity: Updates the velocity based on cognitive, social factors, and repulsion from other particles.
% - update_position: Updates the particleâ€™s position based on the current velocity and applies boundary constraints.
